              <h3>Brief</h3>
              <p>The first step is to collect details regarding the client's business, such as its values, mission, and
                target market. This data aids the designer in comprehending the client's brand image and producing a
                design that precisely reflects it. </p>

              <h3>Revisions </h3>
              <p>Once the initial design is created, the designer will present it to the client for feedback. The client
                can request revisions or changes to the design until they are satisfied with the final product. The
                number of revisions allowed may depend on the designer's policies.</p>

                  <p>My business name was already taken on the internet, so I needed a logo designed. I came across this
                    company and Manny did such a great job making my brand look professional and exactly what I wanted
                    it to be. He's also very quick at answering any questions you might have! Their rates are very
                    affordable so no risk involved in ordering from them.
