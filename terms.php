                and Conditions of Use, including those terms and conditions incorporated by reference. Please read these
                Terms and Conditions carefully. If you do not accept these Terms and Conditions, you may not use the
                <?= $domain_name ?> service. By placing any order with <?= $domain_name ?> you agree to all our
                terms and it is your responsibility to read our terms. <?= $domain_name ?> may revise these Terms and
                Conditions at any time by updating this posting. You should visit this web page periodically to review
                the Terms and Conditions, because they are binding on you. In these Terms and Conditions, all services
                provided by and related to <?= $domain_name ?> and all text, images, photographs, user interface,
                "look" and "feel", data and other content included at https://www.<?= $domain_name ?>.com from time to

                You acknowledge and agree that <?= $domain_name ?> shall have the right (but not the obligation) in
                its sole discretion, to pre-screen, refuse or remove any project and/or user provided content that

                preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce these
                Terms and Conditions; (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third-parties; (d)
                respond to your requests for customer service; or (e) protect the rights, property, or personal safety

              <h3><?= $domain_name ?> Service Generally</h3>
              <p>(a) Description. <?= $domain_name ?> Service is an online service where individuals or entities that
                have signed up with <?= $domain_name ?> as clients (each, a "Client") can post specific assignments
                and project descriptions, including illustrative samples or other media (each, a "Creative Brief"),
                revise those Creative Briefs (each, a "Revision Brief") and obtain responses (each, a "Response") to
                those Creative or Revision Briefs from design experts retained by <?= $domain_name ?> ("Members").
                <?= $domain_name ?> will provide you, as the Client, the Service according to the Package you have
                chosen as detailed in section 1(e) below. Your Responses will be created iteratively through a drafting
                cycle of Creative Briefs, Revision Briefs and Responses, ultimately resulting in a final Response
                conforming to your various Creative and Revision Briefs.<br><br>
                (b) Creative Brief and Responses. You are solely responsible for preparing and posting detailed
                descriptions of each of your Creative Briefs to the Web Site, including providing samples illustrating
                your Creative Brief and any relevant deadlines. For each Response to a Creative Brief that you want to
                receive, a term sheet (a "Term Sheet") will be generated that will contain, and be subject to, the terms
                and conditions you have established for the Creative or Revision Brief. <?= $domain_name ?> is under
                no obligation to review a Creative or Revision Brief or Term Sheet for any purpose, including accuracy,
                completeness of information, quality or clarity. <?= $domain_name ?> may decide, in its sole
                discretion, to deny a Creative or Revision Brief or a Term Sheet.<br><br>
                (c) Reviewing Responses. When <?= $domain_name ?> provides you with a Response, you are responsible
                for reviewing the Response. If you fail to promptly inform <?= $domain_name ?> that the Response is
                not reasonably responsive to the related Term Sheet or Creative Brief, you will be deemed to have
                accepted the Response. If you notify <?= $domain_name ?> that you think a Response is not reasonably
                responsive to the related Creative Brief, you shall then submit to the Web Site a Revision Brief
                containing information regarding amendments or modification to be made to the initial Response. After
                you provide <?= $domain_name ?> with a Revision Brief, <?= $domain_name ?> will provide you with a
                subsequent Response that conforms to the additional criteria you requested. <?= $domain_name ?> is not
                responsible for the content of Responses developed to the extent that such Responses are prepared to
                conform to your Creative or Revision Briefs.<br><br>
                (d) Revision Cycles. Revision cycles generally consist of unlimited additional compositions that
                incorporate changes you request in a Revision Brief. The purpose of the revision process is to create
                Responses that move your project forward in the specific direction you have determined. You may request
                significant changes in the first and second cycles, and the Responses generated might be quite different
                in nature from the original composition you selected. By the third revision request, your requests shall
                be modifications of the current composition only. Revision requests that depart from the then-current
                composition will be honored and completed in a timely manner, however; <?= $domain_name ?> reserves
                the right to charge $50 for each such Revision. No revision work, which requires payment, will be
                started without your authorization.<br><br>
                (e) Packages. You may select from the following Service Packages: logo design packages Logo Startup
                Design Package | Logo Classic Design Package | Logo <?= $domain_name ?> Package | Logo Unlimited Design
                Package<br><br>
                (f) Client Accounts. When you register for the Service, you must pay for the Service via credit card, or
                other payment method authorized by <?= $domain_name ?> You will be charged for the Package you have
                selected along with and additional products and/or services you select as add-ons. If you pay by credit
                card, you will be required to provide a valid credit card number and credit card billing address when
                registering as a Client. <?= $domain_name ?> will email you a receipt for the transactions in which
                you are involved. Our fee policy for Clients may change and we may decide to impose additional fees on
                Clients at any time; however, such additional fees will not apply to projects submitted before <?= $domain_name ?> implements any such change in fees.</p>

              <p>
                (a) Your User Identity. When you register as a Client, you will create a user identity (your "User

                operate. However, your user name need not be your real name. During the registration process, the fields
                requesting information that will be made available to others as part of your User Identity are
                identified. You are responsible for ensuring that you are comfortable making such information available
                to other Web Site users.<br><br>
                (b) Access Numbers, Passwords, and Password Access. You shall keep confidential, shall not disseminate,
                and shall use solely in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, your User Identity, registration
                identification and password for the Web Site. You shall immediately notify <?= $domain_name ?> if you
                learn of or suspect: (i) any loss or theft of your User Identity, registration identification or
                password, or (ii) any unauthorized use of your registration identification or password or of the Web
                Site. In the event of such loss, theft, or unauthorized use, <?= $domain_name ?> may impose on you, at
                <?= $domain_name ?> sole discretion, additional security obligations.<br><br>
                (c) Security Breaches and Revision. If any unauthorized person obtains access to the Web Site as a
                result of any act or omission by you, you shall use your best efforts to ascertain the source and manner
                of acquisition and shall fully and promptly inform <?= $domain_name ?> You shall otherwise cooperate
                and assist in any investigation relating to any such unauthorized access.

                developed, such Client Information, for the full term of any intellectual property rights that may exist
